# data-science-machine-learning-with-python

The objective of this repo is to explore the use of data science techniques for industrial applications and research via using python and recently developed libraries. A series of programs and projects developed inlcude:

- Exploratory data analysis.
- Machine and deep learning including unsupervised and supervised machine learning.
- Generating and dealing with databases and task manager using Python, SQL for a book store shop including functionalities such as gui.
- Finance calculator and sorting algorithms.
- Exploring and applying Machine learning in Computational Fluid Dynamics and Computer Aided Engineering Applications.

Scripts and notebooks and the associated datasets are included in the repo as separate directories for each project.

### Setup
1) Install anaconda or miniconda or setup a `venv` python environment following the relevant docs <https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main>.
2) Install dependenceis in `your_python_env` and ensure python version >3.8. 
   `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3) Learn and code!
